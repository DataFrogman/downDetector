# downDetector

downDetector is an automated challenge downtime detection and recovery tool, designed to recover CTF challenges hosted via Docker.

## This project is currently under development! 

The v0 bash script and configuration for the 2019 RITSEC CTF will be available in the old/ directory until I have completed v1 of the python overhaul.
